# Mystery Word Game 🎮

Small word-guessing game I originally built in **Python** and then adapted to the **web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)**.

## How it works

- Choose one of the modes:
  - **Name** – guess the vocalist name  
  - **Music** – guess the song  
  - **Legacy** – a tribute word  
- Type your guess and press **Enter** or click **Guess**.
- Feedback:
  - `_` → letter is **not in** the word  
  - lowercase → letter is in the word, but in the **wrong position**  
  - UPPERCASE → letter is in the **correct position**

After enough attempts, you get a small hint related to the band behind all words.

## Tech Stack

- HTML

## Next steps (ideas)

- Add animations to the letters (Wordle-style)
- Add more modes / words
- Show history of guesses
